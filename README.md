# Group-Weather-App

React Projects

Your group will collectively choose one of the four projects to work on. Your group should work together to complete this project. Projects do not require any calls to an API, as we are focusing on the frontend/UI - every project can be built using what you’ve learned in class about React.

Project Requirements

    Initializing Repository, Readme.md
    Create wireframe in something like draw.io to get a concept of what the group wants to create
    use props
    use state 
    demonstrate reusable components
    user-friendly (is this easy to use for the user? Hint: you have classmates who are excellent testers for your project.) 
    written from scratch (i.e. do not repurpose other people’s code) 
    mobile-friendly (i.e. you want to eventually pull this app up on your phone to show a potential recruiter or someone in the tech community if you are out at an event.) 
    responsiveness 
    Unique and readable design - Be Creative!
